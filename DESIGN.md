# Schema additions
- add table to hierarchy and cube
- add validation layer, after doing the basic conversion? This way it's easier to track errors, and not do add-hoc conversion and error-checking at the same time.
- check that hierarchy names don't have duplicates (Error: Duplicate name {}, which may be a result of falling back to default name for multiple non-named hierarchies)
- allow non-named hierarchies?
